 <div> <!-- first paragraph (intro) -->
 <p>Fjords are bodies of water characterised by the steep U-shaped walls that surround them. They are most commonly associated with <b>Norway</b>, <b>New Zealand</b>, and the <b>Arctic</b>. Because of their majestic and awe-inspiring natural appearance, they are a popular destination for tourists. Beyond this, fjords are also the home to a diverse and thriving <b>ecosystem</b>, composed of corals, invertebrates and fish. Larger animals also frequent the fjords too- Humpback and Killer whales can be found in the fjords of Norway. The fjords of New Zealand host dolphins, penguins and seals.</p>

 <div> <!-- second paragraph (fjords and glaciers) -->
 <p>Fjords were formed by the moving of<b>glaciers</b>. To this day, the fate of glaciers and fjords are deeply intertwined. Because of the warming of the earth, glaciers are melting at a <b>rapid</b> rate, and have been since the <b>Industrial revolution</b>. This not only affects the glaciers themselves, but causes a rise in <b>global sea levels</b>, an increase in hurricanes and typhoons, and the disruption of weather patterns. The melting of tidewater glaciers causes an influx of freshwater and terrestrial materials such as sedimentary rocks and soils into fjords. This disrupts the <b>natural circulation</b> of fjords, having a big impact on the chemical make-up of fjords and their ecosystems.</p>
 </div>
 
 <div> <!-- third paragraph (greenhouse effect) -->
 <p>At the root of the issue is the <b>anthropogenic greenhouse effect</b>. This phrase describes the greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane that are released into the <b>troposphere</b> by human activity. These gases aid in trapping heat, thus making Earth habitable to all living beings alike. However, the increase of gases released by human activity has been contributing to a global change in climate that is far from natural or safe for the earth and its inhabitants. It has been shown that the <b>tropopause</b> (which sits between the troposphere and the stratosphere), has risen at least 50 meters over the last 20 years, which in turn causes a rise in the Earth's surface temperature. </p>

 </figure>
 </div>
 
 <div> <!-- fourth paragraph (causes of climate change) -->
 <p>The anthropogenic greenhouse effect is caused by a myriad of human activities. Among the most notorious are:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>The burning of coal, oil and gasses to provide energy to households, businesses, cars and factories. This alone contributes about <b>75 percent</b> to greenhouse gasses.</li>
 <li>Deforestation, in order to make way for agriculture and industrialisation, contributes from <b>12 to 20 percent</b> of greenhouse gasses. </li>
 <li>Livestock production, which involves a large amount of water and resources to raise animals. Animals such as cows and sheep also release large amounts of methane into the atmosphere. It is estimated that livestock production contributes <b>16 percent</b> to greenhouse gasses.</li>
 </ul>
 </div>
 
 <div> <!-- fifth paragraph (summary) -->
 <p>All these factors contribute to the melting of glaciers and the unbalancing of the fjord's natural resources, but these bodies of water are far from the only thing impacted by climate change. Climate change does not only alter the ecosystems and natural formations of the earth, but has disastrous implications for humanity. The unnatural warming of the earth exacerbates natural disasters, such as heat waves, floods and droughts, which humans are all affected by. </p>

 <p>A study done by the European Geosciences Union seeks to use stable isotopic analysis of dissolved nitrate in order to investigate the net impact of global warming on fjords. The sites chosen are located in <b>Svalbard</b>, an archipelago of Norway- Kongsfjorden and Rijpfjorden. The aim is to be able to better predict the effect global warming will have on fjords in the future. The organisation behind the study is a <b>non-profit</b> organisation headquartered in <b>Germany</b>, who operates under the statement: "to realise a sustainable and just future for humanity and for the planet." This shows that the organisation has an <b>ecocentric</b> ideology, and a focus on sustainability and the preservation of nature.</p>

 <div> <!-- seventh paragraph (research over the years)-->
 <p>Research on Climate Change has been done for many years. The first study that made a direct connection between the burning of coal and the warming of the climate happened in 1896. It was conducted by a chemist named <b>Svante Arrhenius</b>. However, the lack of technology at the time meant that he could not estimate accurately the rate at which temperatures would rise. He also concluded that the rise in temperature would be good for humanity. Arrhenius had a background in physics and chemistry, and he studied at the <b>Cathedral School</b> in Uppsala. Although he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for an unrelated study, his work on greenhouse gasses was largely ignored in his life time.</p>

 <div> <!-- eigth paragraph (research, cont.) -->
 <p>Similarly to Arrhenius, in 1938, a coal engineer named <b>Guy Stewart Callendar</b> predicted that the effects of global warming would actually be beneficial to mankind. He stated that the increase in carbon dioxide and temperature would melt the "deadly" glaciers. In 1992 it was discovered by American scientists seawater's <b>acidity levels</b> were rising due to the increase in carbon dioxide in oceans, which posed a problem for marine animals and corals. In 2016, carbon dioxide moved <b>above 400 PPM</b>, meaning that 0.04% of all air particles are carbon dioxide molecules.</p>

 <p>These studies show that the increase in carbon dioxide and the rising temperature of the earth has been measured and observed for centuries. As technology has gotten better, scientists have switched to creating climate models to better predict the future.</p>

 <h2>Is There a Solution?</h2>
 </div>
 
 <div>
 <p>To help save fjords and the complex ecosystems that depend on them, it is crucial to tackle the <b>underlying problem</b> that is causing the rise in global sea levels- <b>human-accelerated climate change</b>. As mentioned before, the release of greenhouse gasses from energy production, deforestation and farming is causing the earth to warm at unnatural rates. Many people all over the world are coming up with ways to help the environment in any way they can. For example, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.un.org/en/actnow/ten-actions">United Nations website</a> lists ten actions that individuals can take in their day to day life to reduce their carbon emissions. For example, individuals are encouraged to be wary of their <b>energy use</b> at home, or to use a different energy source such as wind and solar panels all together. Public transport, biking and walking also emits less carbon than cars. <b>Recycling</b>, <b>reusing</b> and <b>reducing</b> the consumption of products is also mentioned. Importantly, a mindset shift from temporary cheap products to sustainable and durable purchases is encouraged. Furthermore, a vegetarian diet can eliminate 500 kilograms of carbon dioxide per year, and a vegan diet 900 kilograms. The UN also encourages individuals to "vote with their wallet", by buying sustainable products to encourage companies to be more environmentally conscious. All these actions can make a small difference, but because the vast majority of greenhouse gas emissions are not the fault of individuals, many believe that no matter how ethically one lives their life, its contribution to the environmental will be minuscule.</p>

</div>

<div>

<p>This brings us to the second solution. The last action mentioned by the article is to speak up, educate others and <b>campaign</b> for what they believe is right. This involves trying to influence companies and industries to change their environmentally damaging ways by boycotting, protesting and signing petitions. For example, students might go on strike to demonstrate that the younger generation cares about climate change and that governments and companies must take action to save the earth. People might campaign for politicians and governments to sign agreements such as the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/paris-climate-agreement-everything-you-need-know">Paris Agreement</a> that will put legal limits in place to help aid in the slowing of climate change.</p>

</div>

 <div>

</figure

<div>

<p>The last solution involves the most <b>drastic</b> change. Some people seek to change the system as a whole because they believe the current one is inherently flawed, and that climate change, along with all its negative consequences, will continue as long as the system stays. These people might encourage communities to grow their own food, as opposed to sending in food from around the globe, as the carbon emissions from travel are massive. More importantly, this makes the communities <b>self-sustainable</b>, and the people are less reliant on the whims of global corporations and governments. Values such as co-operation, compassion, mutual aid and strong community bonds are encouraged, and held as vital to survival. One <b>political ideology</b> that is closely related to this course of action is <b>de-growth</b>. Proponents of de-growth argue that rather than encouraging economic growth, the <b>opposite</b> should happen. Less energy should be used, less products manufactured, less items bought and used by individuals in wealthy countries. An article from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-04412-x">Nature.com</a> lists "scaling down" the meat and dairy industry, fast fashion and fossil fuels as a part of de-growth. As you can see, these solutions are interconnected with each other and are not mutually exclusive.</p>

</div>

<div>

<p>While the fjords of Norway and New Zealand may seem a mile away from the lives we lead, the items we produce, the energy we spend and the factories we depend on, these factors are the cause of the melting of glaciers, and thus the flow of materials into fjords which disrupts their natural ecosystems.</p>
