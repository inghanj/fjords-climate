 <div> <!-- first paragraph (intro) -->
 <p>Fjords are bodies of water characterised by the steep U-shaped walls that surround them. They are most commonly associated with Norway, New Zealand, and the Arctic. Because of their majestic and awe-inspiring natural appearance, they are a popular destination for tourists. Beyond this, fjords are also the home to a diverse and thriving ecosystem, composed of corals, invertebrates and fish. Larger animals also frequent the fjords too- Humpback and Killer whales can be found in the fjords of Norway. The fjords of New Zealand host dolphins, penguins and seals.</p>

 <div> <!-- second paragraph (fjords and glaciers) -->
 <p>Fjords were formed by the moving of glaciers. To this day, the fate of glaciers and fjords are deeply intertwined. Because of the warming of the earth, glaciers are melting at a rapid rate, and have been since the Industrial revolution. This not only affects the glaciers themselves, but causes a rise in global sea levels, an increase in hurricanes and typhoons, and the disruption of weather patterns. The melting of tidewater glaciers causes an influx of freshwater and terrestrial materials such as sedimentary rocks and soils into fjords. This disrupts the natural circulation of fjords, having a big impact on the chemical make-up of fjords and their ecosystems.</p>

 <div> <!-- third paragraph (greenhouse effect) -->
 <p>At the root of the issue is the anthropogenic greenhouse effect. This phrase describes the greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane that are released into the troposphere by human activity. These gases aid in trapping heat, thus making Earth habitable to all living beings alike. However, the increase of gases released by human activity has been contributing to a global change in climate that is far from natural or safe for the earth and its inhabitants. It has been shown that the tropopause (which sits between the troposphere and the stratosphere), has risen at least 50 meters over the last 20 years, which in turn causes a rise in the Earth's surface temperature. </p>
 </div>
 
 <div> <!-- fourth paragraph (causes of climate change) -->
 <p>The anthropogenic greenhouse effect is caused by a myriad of human activities. Among the most notorious are:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>The burning of coal, oil and gasses to provide energy to households, businesses, cars and factories. This alone contributes about 75 percent to greenhouse gasses.</li>
 <li>Deforestation, in order to make way for agriculture and industrialisation, contributes from 12 to 20 percent of greenhouse gasses. </li>
 <li>Livestock production, which involves a large amount of water and resources to raise animals. Animals such as cows and sheep also release large amounts of methane into the atmosphere. It is estimated that livestock production contributes 16 percent to greenhouse gasses.</li>
 </ul>
 </div>
 
 <div> <!-- fifth paragraph (summary) -->
 <p>All these factors contribute to the melting of glaciers and the unbalancing of the fjord's natural resources, but these bodies of water are far from the only thing impacted by climate change. Climate change does not only alter the ecosystems and natural formations of the earth, but has disastrous implications for humanity. The unnatural warming of the earth exacerbates natural disasters, such as heat waves, floods and droughts, which humans are all affected by. </p>

 <div> <!-- sixth paragraph (climate change research)-->
 <p>A study done by the European Geosciences Union seeks to use stable isotopic analysis of dissolved nitrate in order to investigate the net impact of global warming on fjords. The sites chosen are located in Norway- Kongsfjorden and Rijpfjorden. The aim is to be able to better predict the effect global warming will have on fjords in the future. The organisation behind the study is a non-profit organisation headquartered in Germany, who operates under the statement: "to realise a sustainable and just future for humanity and for the planet." This shows that the organisation has an ecocentric ideology, and a focus on sustainability and the preservation of nature.</p>

 <div> <!-- seventh paragraph (research over the years)-->
 <p>Research on Climate Change has been done for many years. The first study that made a direct connection between the burning of coal and the warming of the climate happened in 1896. It was conducted by a chemist named Svante Arrhenius. However, the lack of technology at the time meant that he could not estimate accurately the rate at which temperatures would rise. He also concluded that the rise in temperature would be a good thing for humanity. Arrhenius had a background in physics and chemistry, and he studied at the Cathedral School in Uppsala. Although he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for an unrelated study, his work on greenhouse gasses was largely ignored in his life time. They were only taken seriously in 1970, where the effects of climate change became more of a threat to people.</p>

 <div> <!-- eigth paragraph (research, cont.) -->
 <p>Similarly to Arrhenius, in 1938, a coal engineer named George Callendar predicted that the effects of global warming would actually be beneficial to mankind. He stated that the increase in carbon dioxide and temperature would melt the "deadly" glaciers. In 1992 it was discovered by American scientists seawater's acidity levels were rising due to the increase in carbon dioxide in oceans, which posed a problem for marine animals and corals. In 2016, carbon dioxide moved above 400 PPM, meaning that 0.04% of all air particles are carbon dioxide molecules.</p>
 
 <p>These studies show that the increase in carbon dioxide and the rising temperature of the earth has been measured and observed for centuries. As technology has gotten better, scientists have switched to creating climate models to better predict the future.</p>
